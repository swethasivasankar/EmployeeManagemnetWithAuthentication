# What is CQRS?

CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It is an Architectural Design Pattern that advocates segregating or grouping the methods based on how they impact the data and design them separately according to their requirements. CQRS helps segregate functionalities into two different models - Commands and Queries, there by creating a clear separation of concerns for each functionality.

# Technologies

* ASP.NET Core (.NET 6)
* Entity Framework Core (EFCore 6)
* MediatR for .NET 6
* Fluent Validation for .NET 6
* SQLite
